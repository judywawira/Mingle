_Mingle_ is a [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org) that experiments with _"Asocial Networking"_.
The goal is to minimize ability to data-mine information regarding the user population or subsets of it,
without sacrificing public accessibility. Hopefully, this will be achieved by:

* Maintaining [anonymous accountability](http://couchappsec.couch.it/Anonymous_accountability)
as much as possible (at the moment you're only
"[fairly anonymous](https://github.com/thedod/Mingle/wiki/How-anonymous-is-fairly-anonymous)")

* Keeping the content publicly available, but managing and sharing relations (follow / like / tag / etc.) out of band:

  * Locally inside the browser

  * Via private text mediums (email, IM, etc.)

  * Publicly (on blogs and sites) if a user wishes to do so

  * Eventually - integration with external and deniable storage mechanisms
    (anything from [pastebin](http://pastebin.com) to [refuge.io](http://refuge.io))

At the moment, only the first goal (anonymous accountability) was [fairly] achieved.
